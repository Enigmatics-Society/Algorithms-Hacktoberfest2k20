#Desription of the Algorithm
-Start
-Declare variables i, no1,no2,no3
-Initialize the variables, no1=0, no2=1, and no3 =0
-Enter the number of terms of Fibonacci series to be printed
-Print First two terms of series
-Use loop for the following steps
-> no3=no1+no2
-> num1=num2
-> num2=num3
-> increase value of i each time by 1
-> print the value of no3
End


#Sample Input Output
Enter the number of elements 10<br/>                                                                         
Series are : 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
